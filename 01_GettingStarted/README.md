# Getting Started
## Entity Relationship Model
When you start developing a server, we need to design our schemas properly.
```
Open folder: 01_EntityRelationshipModel to see our schemas
```
Through that, we need to have experience:
1. What is tbl1, tbl2, tbl3 in schemas?
2. 

## Collect raw data
When you have a schema, you need collect data from customer. 
```
Open folder 02_RawData to see our data
```
Through that, we need to have experience:
1. How do you import the raw data properly?
2. 

## Create a draft server on PostgreSQL
From your schemas, we need to create a script to implement PostgreSQL Server.
```
Open folder 03_PostgreSQL to see your script
```
Through that, we need to have experience:
1. What experience we design data type in script SQL?
2. Why we need select a exact data type for each column in table?
3. How many data-type in SQL script? What things you need to remember?
